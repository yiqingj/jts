# JTS Tools

JTS includes some application tools to make it easier to work with geometry and JTS functions.

Tools are run using shell scripts in the JTS `bin` directory.

* [**JTS TestBuilder**](JTSTestBuilder.md) is a GUI for creating, editing, and processing geometry
* [**JtsOp**](JTSOp.md) is a command-line interface (CLI) to JTS for running operations on geometry
* **TestRunner** is a utility to run JTS XML unit test files
